                    <p>
                        Darwin is one of the most important datafeeds in the railway industry. It powers uncountable train operating companies and railway service providers, and allows them to deliver high quality train services that get us from A to B every day.

                    <h1>Innovating. <b>One Dataset</b> at a time.</h1>
                    <p>
                        Given the importance of this datafeed, the HackTrain kick-started the Darwin RESTful project - an unofficial Darwin REST interface supported by the HackTrain team. Our vision with this project is to empower trainhackers to build unique, revolutionary projects that will revolutionize the train industry.

                        ecosystem, constantly studying and finding ways to
                        improve and extend functionality as new and better
                        ideas surface. Our diverse products, such as the

                            technology to support extremely rapid UI iteration
                            for our 10,000+ client-facing applications.</li>

                            <li>We were ahead in the use of GPU’s for the

                            pricings. And we designed one of the first
                            frameworks for a low-latency, high-throughput,
                            fault-tolerant service-oriented architecture.</li>

                            <li>We are a main sponsor of SQLite, and we’ve
                            open-sourced our own augmented C++ STL, and “BDE”
                            to support the privately available and soon to be

                            <li>We developed and deployed an ultra-low-latency

                      <p>Our teams of tech experts solve unique, complex
                        problems on a daily basis and we need dynamic engineers
                        who can thrive in a fast-paced, creative environment.
                        We strive to hire developers with diverse backgrounds
                        in fields such as computer science, engineering,
                        physics, and mathematics, so we can rapidly deploy
                        software solutions designed and built by a mix of
                        experiences. While an interest in or knowledge of
                        finance can help, it is certainly not required.</p>

                        <p>Transparency, project ownership and an open
                        structure without titles are just some of the reasons
                        why we are unique as a technology company in the
                        financial space. You will collaborate with smart,
                        passionate people who are unafraid to experiment and
                        deviate from the status quo, and who will push and
                        challenge you. The atmosphere can be intense, but is
                        always friendly and often fun. We are always
                        learning.</p>
